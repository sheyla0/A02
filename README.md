### Glossary 
-**Branch**: A branch is a separate line of development that allows you to work on a specific feature or bug fix without affecting the main or other branches. Branches are used to isolate changes and can later be merged back into the main branch when the work is complete.

-**Clone**: Cloning refers to the process of creating a copy of a Git repository, including all its files, commit history, and branches.

-**Commit**: A commit in Git represents a snapshot of changes made to a repository at a specific point in time. Commits include a message describing the changes made.

-**Fetch**: Fetching is the Git operation that retrieves changes from a remote repository but does not merge them into the current working branch. It updates your local copy of the remote repository's branch to reflect any new commits.

-**GIT**: Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code and other text-based files. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project while keeping a history of all changes.

-**Github**: GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It offers collaboration tools, issue tracking, and other features that make it easier for individuals and teams to work with Git repositories.

-**Merge**: It brings together the changes made in different branches to create a single unified branch.

-**Merge Conflict**: A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes from one branch into another because both branches have made conflicting changes to the same part of a file.

-**Push**: Pushing is the process of sending the committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository, making those changes available to others who are working on the same project.

-**Pull**: Pulling is the process of fetching changes from a remote repository and merging them into your current branch. It is a combination of the fetch and merge operations.

-**Remote**: A remote is a reference to a repository located on another server, typically on the internet. It allows you to interact with and fetch changes from repositories hosted elsewhere.

-**Repository**: A Git repository, often referred to as a repo, is a data structure that stores a project's files, history, and configuration.
